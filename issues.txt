Biscuit:

* two initial checks to confirm that the provided test fails with all (non-pinned) plugins enabled, and then passes with all disabled.

* would be nice to not have to press enter when the vim subprocess errors (like missing colorscheme)

* need a way to indicate that all bisections completed without locating failing plugin - while loop needs tweaking
