INTRODUCTION                                    *pathogen*

Without a plugin manager, installing, upgrading and removing plugins
in Vim is painful, clumsy and frustrating. Pathogen solves all these
problems by providing individual install directories for each plugin.

It does this by keeping all plugins in a "bundle" directory. This
bundle directory is typically:
>
  ~/.vim/bundle/
<

But pathogen actually allows for multiple bundle directories. See
|pathogen-bundle| for more details.

Installing a plugin is then a simple matter of copying the plugin to its
own subdirectory beneath the bundle directory. Removing plugins is as
easy as removing that subdirectory. Because the plugins are isolated
within their own subdirectories, upgrading becomes a simple matter of
removing the old and installing the new, modulo some attention to
possibly persistent user-data that some plugins rely on.

The Plugin Command                             *pathogen-plugin*

Everything in pathogen is controlled through the Plugin command. Using
a familiar cascading command style (ala subversion or git), the Plugin
command has the following subcommands:

list / list all                                *list-all*

This shows a nicely formatted list of all plugins currently installed
in Vim. The enabled plugins have a leading '+' character, whereas a
leading '-' character is used to show that a plugin is currently
disabled.

list enabled                                   *list-enabled*

This will list all of the enabled plugins current installed in Vim. To
disable a plugin, use the |plugin-disable| command.

list disabled                                  *list-disabled*

This will list all of the disabled plugins current installed in Vim. To
enable a plugin, use the |plugin-enable| command.

install                                        *install*
>
example:

  :Plugin install TagList
<

This will use the vim-addon-manager to install the named plugin (here,
the great TagList plugin). You will need to have vim-addon-manager
installed to use this feature. See |pathogen-vam| for more details.

enable                                         *enable*
>
example:

  :Plugin enable TagList
<

This will enable an installed plugin. If the plugin was already
enabled then nothing happens. If it was disabled, then the named
plugin will become active again when a new Vim session is started. You
will have to restart your current Vim session or start a new one to
see the effect.

disable                                        *disable*
>
example:

  :Plugin disable TagList
<

This will disable an installed plugin. If the plugin was already
disabled then nothing happens. If it was enabled, then the named
plugin will become inactive when a new Vim session is started. You
will have to restart your current Vim session or start a new one to
see the effect.

remove                                         *remove*
>
example:

  :Plugin remove TagList
<

This will uninstall the named plugin.  You will need to have
vim-addon-manager installed to use this feature.  See |pathogen-vam|
for more details.

VIM ADDON MANAGER                              *pathogen-vam*

Pathogen is able to use Marc Werber's great Vim Addon Manager to
install and remove plugins. You can get VAM from XXX . That page also has
the necessary install instructions. Once you have installed VAM,
restart Vim and try:
>
  :Plugin install your-desired-plugin-here
<

CONFIGURATION                                   *pathogen-configuration*

Pathogen stores its plugin configuration within the following file:
>
  ~/.vim/bundled_plugins
>

While it is possible for you to edit this file manually, there should
really be no need to do so. All of pathogen's functionality is
available through the |pathogen-plugin| command.

ISSUES                                          *pathogen-issues*

There are no known issues with this version of pathogen. Please let
one of the following active maintainers know if you find any bugs:

Israel can also be found lurking as Raimondi on #vim on freenode.net
